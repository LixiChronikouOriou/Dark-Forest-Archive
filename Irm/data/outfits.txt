	description "The Remnant sell these devices as an addendum to the Quantum Keystones. Quantum Keystones are occasionally subject to some sort of energetic build-up where their ordinary workings are interfered with, this is what these devices prevent."

	description "The geometry and subsequent workings of this technology seem incomprehensible to any user. However, surprisingly, it proves more than a match for any set of engines of a similar size, especially any that allows for fully-fledged maneuverability. Tekina engines boast a very conservative drain on a ship's resources, far outshining the efficiency of many engines available in this size."
