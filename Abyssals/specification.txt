
Abyssals
Creatures whose body resembles an Urchin with short spikes, with four long limbs that it uses for locomotion, or used as arms and hands. The "main body", the urchin-like structure, is about half a meter in diameter, Aristotle's lantern facing the ground. The limbs usually keep the main body at about over a meter off the ground, but can stretch to almost double that.
Homeworld was destroyed shortly after they managed to escape to other systems, sending many shuttles in different directions

Abyssal Trench
An area of the galaxy with an unusually high amount of black holes, though some other types of stars can be found. Extremely poor in natural mineral resources. System hazards via ships like Kor nanobots, but only deal hull damage. These hazards coupled with the instability of their home system's black hole led to the homeworld's destruction or something.

Organization
After splitting into several different directions in their shuttles, centuries later they've grown to be much like ancient greece, with enclaves of 1-system governments that are independent from one another, though may trade, ally, blockade, or go to war. Ingame would be represented by them having different swizzles but the same government color for planets (go "Abyssal", " Abyssal ", "  Abyssal  "... as needed)
