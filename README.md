# Dark Forest Archive

Selected collection of inactive (not touched for years) or abandoned (deleted repository) projects which introduce material for new species. Archived for inspiration and hopefully some kind of revival.

Actually there are more interesting species out there in the wild. This archive just contains those, for which I more or less have a rough ideas on what to do next. So, the list may be extended.
